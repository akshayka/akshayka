### Hi, I'm Akshay ðŸ‘‹

I build foundational Python tools for developers who work with data. 

- ðŸ’» I'm currently working on [marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo), a new kind of reactive Python notebook.
- ðŸ”­ I developed [PyMDE](https://github.com/cvxgrp/pymde), a PyTorch library for computing custom embeddings of large datasets.
- ðŸ–© I'm a maintainer and developer of [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy), a widely-used library for mathematical optimization.
- ðŸ“š I love writing. I write [blog posts](https://www.debugmind.com/2020/01/04/paths-to-the-future-a-year-at-google-brain/), research [papers](https://www.akshayagrawal.com/), and books, including a [book on embeddings](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/min_dist_emb.html).
- ðŸŽ“ I graduated from Stanford University with a PhD, advised by [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/index.html). All my papers are accompanied by open-source software.

I'm always open to conversations. Reach me via [email](mailto:akshay@marimo.io).
